# DESKPILOTC STATE

## Project
**D_DeskPilotC**

## Repository
Private GitHub repository: `mskaymaz/D_DeskPilotC`

## Current Phase
**Phase 0 — Project Foundation and Specification**

## Current Status
Project documentation and architectural foundation are being established. Minimal C++ + Qt 6 + Qt Quick/QML application foundation has been created, built, and launched successfully.

## Completed
- Existing Python/PyQt DeskPilot repository was frozen.
- Frozen reference was tagged as `deskpilot-python-freeze`.
- Python reference remains the behavioral/product reference.
- New `D_DeskPilotC` repository was created and connected to GitHub.
- `PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE_PRINCIPLES_AI_EN.md` added.
- `DESKPILOT_PRODUCT_SPEC.md` added.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` added.
- `ROADMAP.md` added.
- `TASK.md` created.
- `STATE.md` created.

## Frozen Python Reference Point
The Python DeskPilot was frozen near the end of Desktop V1 development. Core desktop functionality, Clock, Date, Battery, layout behavior, Quick Actions, Settings, Todo, tray, and related infrastructure were substantially developed. Reminder development had just entered its final major implementation/polish stage.

DeskPilotC must reach the intended Desktop V1 product scope while rebuilding the implementation on a clean C++ + Qt 6 + Qt Quick/QML architecture.

## Architecture Direction
- Desktop UI: Qt 6 + Qt Quick/QML
- Core/native layer: Modern C++
- Build system: CMake
- Initial platform: Windows
- Local structured storage direction: SQLite
- Future mobile reference: Flutter + Dart
- Future web reference: TypeScript + React + Next.js
- Future sync: separate optional account/synchronization layer

Qt licensing baseline: use Qt Community/Open Source with LGPL-compatible modules where possible; avoid paid/commercial-only dependencies and review licenses before adding new Qt modules.

## Important Product Rule
The frozen Python implementation defines intended behavior, not implementation architecture.

Do not:
- mechanically translate Python code to C++;
- copy QWidget-specific workarounds;
- reinterpret settled product decisions without user approval;
- start Sync/Mobile/Web work before Desktop V1 unless explicitly requested.

## Development Workflow
Use the SPP-style workflow:
1. Analyze and verify first.
2. Work on one agreed task at a time.
3. Keep changes focused.
4. Avoid unrelated refactoring.
5. Verify each implementation before continuing.
6. Update `TASK.md` and `STATE.md` after meaningful milestones.
7. Update `ROADMAP.md` when phase-level progress changes.

Commands and patches should be concise and fail-fast. When working interactively with the user, provide one implementation step at a time and wait for the result when later steps depend on it.

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Add this `TASK.md` and `STATE.md` to the repository root.
2. Create initial `README.md`.
3. Define Qt licensing baseline.
4. Verify installed Windows C++ / Qt 6 / CMake toolchain.
5. Select exact Qt/compiler baseline.
6. Create minimal project structure and CMake configuration.
7. Build and run the first minimal Qt Quick/QML application.
8. Commit and push the verified Phase 0 foundation.

## AI Agent Continuation Instruction
Before modifying this repository, read in this order:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `STATE.md`
3. `TASK.md`
4. `ROADMAP.md`
5. `DESKPILOT_PRODUCT_SPEC.md`
6. `ARCHITECTURE.md`
7. `PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE_PRINCIPLES_AI_EN.md`

Continue from the current state. Do not restart architectural interpretation unless a real conflict or new requirement requires a decision.

Communicate with the user in Turkish unless explicitly requested otherwise.
